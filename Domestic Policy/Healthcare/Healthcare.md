# Healthcare

This section establishes the framework for basic and essential human health services from prenatal to hospice care. 

# Prenatal: 

Healthcare begins when a new set of DNA is created. All entities with unique and living DNA are considered individuals for the purpose of healthcare. 

# Hospice: 

Healthcare ends with the dignified and respectful end of natural life of a unique and living DNA.
