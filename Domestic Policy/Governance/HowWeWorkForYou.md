# How We Work For You: 

Hi, we're your new government. You don't know us yet, but you will. Don't get weird. It's like getting a new neighbor. Now that I could very well be living next door to you, don't you want to know who your neighbor is? 

As the people you pay through your taxes and as your public servants, we promise the following: 

# 1: We Will Never Spam You: 

# 2: We work for you. Not the other way around. 

# 3: You all have a voice

We all have a voice, but not everything is in proportion in terms of us listening. How can we help there? 
Although we do have different sized megaphones, we are able to join voices in a like mind. 

# 4: We Do Not Bundle Our Services
You can a separate phone, cell, internet, and security service. That's what makes US great! Competing ideas, products, thoughts, feelings, and sometimes actions. We strive for a violence-free society. Violence will NOT be met with violence, but a more severe form of punishment. If you are violent against someone and you are caught, each and every other crime that you are suspected of will carry their individual and cumulative maximum allowed punishment if found guilty. 

In addition, while you are serving your sentence, you will be required to obtain a Masters Degree in either biology, mathematics, chemical, physics, or similar higher degree. This degree must come from one of the 20 highest rated Universities in the World, or a highly accredited US University in the top 25 of the US.
